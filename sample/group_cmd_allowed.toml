# Group-level command allowlist example
#
# This configuration demonstrates the `cmd_allowed` feature that allows
# specific commands to be executed within a group, even if they are not
# matched by hardcoded global allowed command patterns.
#
# Hardcoded global patterns (not configurable from TOML):
#   - ^/bin/.*
#   - ^/usr/bin/.*
#   - ^/usr/sbin/.*
#   - ^/usr/local/bin/.*
#
# Key features:
#   - Commands in `cmd_allowed` must be absolute paths
#   - Variable expansion (%{variable}) is supported
#   - Works with OR condition: command is allowed if it matches EITHER
#     hardcoded global patterns OR group-level `cmd_allowed` list
#   - Other security checks (permissions, risk assessment) still apply
