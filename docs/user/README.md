[[groups]]
name = "backup"
description = "Database backup"

[[groups.commands]]
name = "db_backup"
cmd = "/usr/bin/pg_dump"
args = ["mydb"]
output = "backup.sql"
run_as_user = "postgres"
max_risk_level = "medium"
```

## Working Directory Configuration

### Default Behavior (Recommended)

If `workdir` is not specified at the group level, a temporary directory is automatically generated.
The temporary directory is automatically deleted after the group execution completes.

```toml
[[groups]]
name = "backup"

[[groups.commands]]
name = "dump"
cmd = "pg_dump"
args = ["mydb", "-f", "%{__runner_workdir}/dump.sql"]
# Output to /tmp/scr-backup-XXXXXX/dump.sql
```

### Using a Fixed Directory

To use a fixed directory, specify `workdir` at the group level.

```toml
[[groups]]
name = "build"
workdir = "/opt/app"

[[groups.commands]]
name = "compile"
cmd = "make"
```

### Reserved Variable `%{__runner_workdir}`

Use `%{__runner_workdir}` at the command level to reference the working directory at execution time.

### Keeping Temporary Directories

To keep temporary directories for debugging purposes, use the `--keep-temp-dirs` flag.

```bash
$ ./runner --config backup.toml --keep-temp-dirs
```

## Security

### [Security Risk Assessment](security-risk-assessment.md)

Explains command risk levels and evaluation criteria.

**Contents:**
- Risk level definitions (low, medium, high, critical)
- Risk assessment by command
- Risk-based control methods

**Risk Levels:**
- **Low**: Basic read operations (ls, cat, grep)
- **Medium**: File modifications, package management (cp, mv, apt)
- **High**: System administration, destructive operations (systemctl, rm -rf)
- **Critical**: Privilege escalation (sudo, su) - Always blocked

## Practical Workflows

### Typical Usage Flow

```
1. Create configuration file
   └─ Refer to TOML Configuration File Guide

2. Record hash values
   └─ Use record command to record hashes of executables and configuration files

3. Validate configuration
   └─ runner -config config.toml -validate

4. Verify with dry run
   └─ runner -config config.toml -dry-run

5. Production execution
   └─ runner -config config.toml

6. Troubleshooting (as needed)
   └─ Use verify command to check file integrity
```

### Initial Setup Example

```bash
# 1. Create configuration file
cat > /etc/go-safe-cmd-runner/backup.toml << 'EOF'
version = "1.0"

[global]
timeout = 3600
env_allowlist = ["PATH", "HOME"]

[[groups]]
name = "backup"

[[groups.commands]]
name = "db_backup"
cmd = "/usr/bin/pg_dump"
args = ["-U", "postgres", "mydb"]
output = "/var/backups/db.sql"
run_as_user = "postgres"
EOF

# 2. Create hash directory
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/go-safe-cmd-runner/hashes
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/etc/go-safe-cmd-runner/hashes

# 3. Record hashes
sudo record -file /etc/go-safe-cmd-runner/backup.toml \
    -hash-dir /usr/local/etc/go-safe-cmd-runner/hashes

sudo record -file /usr/bin/pg_dump \
    -hash-dir /usr/local/etc/go-safe-cmd-runner/hashes

# 4. Validate configuration
runner -config /etc/go-safe-cmd-runner/backup.toml -validate

# 5. Verify with dry run
runner -config /etc/go-safe-cmd-runner/backup.toml -dry-run

# 6. Production execution
