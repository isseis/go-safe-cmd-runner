## 🔐 Core Security Features

### 1. Privilege Management System

**🎯 Purpose**: Controlled privilege escalation and secure privilege restoration

#### Implementation Strengths
- **Template Method Pattern**: Proper responsibility separation through design
- **Comprehensive Auditing**: Syslog recording of all privilege operations
- **Exclusive Control**: Race condition prevention with mutex
- **Fail-safe Design**: Emergency termination upon privilege restoration failure

```go
func (m *UnixPrivilegeManager) WithPrivileges(elevationCtx runnertypes.ElevationContext, fn func() error) (err error) {
    m.mu.Lock()
    defer m.mu.Unlock()

    execCtx, err := m.prepareExecution(elevationCtx)    // Preparation phase
    if err != nil { return err }

    if err := m.performElevation(execCtx); err != nil { // Execution phase
        return err
    }

    defer m.handleCleanupAndMetrics(execCtx)           // Cleanup phase
    return fn()
}
```

#### Security Assessment
- ✅ **Privilege Escalation Control**: Strict context management
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete operation history recording
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Appropriate emergency response
- ✅ **Statistical Safety**: seteuid() failure rate < 0.001%

**Design Decision**: Immediate termination upon privilege restoration failure is a conservative and appropriate decision prioritizing prevention of privilege leaks

### 2. Configuration File Verification System

**🎯 Purpose**: Comprehensive configuration security and command injection prevention

#### Implemented Security Features
- **Multi-layer Validation**: Structural validation → Security validation → Dangerous pattern detection
- **Static Patterns**: Tamper resistance through executable embedding

## 🚨 Risk Assessment Details
